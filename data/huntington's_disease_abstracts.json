        "title": "Mitochondrial DNA editing: Key to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.",
        "abstract": "Neuronal death is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondrial DNA becomes damaged when processes such as replication, repair, and nucleotide synthesis are compromised. This extensive accumulation of damaged mitochondrial DNA subsequently disrupts the normal function of mitochondria, leading to aging, degeneration, or even death of neurons. Mitochondrial dysfunction stands as a pivotal factor in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Recognizing the intricate nature of their pathogenesis, there is an urgent need for more effective therapeutic interventions. In recent years, mitochondrial DNA editing tools such as zinc finger nucleases, double-stranded DNA deaminase toxin A-derived cytosine base editors, and transcription activator-like effector ligand deaminases have emerged. Their emergence will revolutionize the research and treatment of mitochondrial diseases. In this review, we summarize the advancements in mitochondrial base editing technology and anticipate its utilization in neurodegenerative diseases, offering insights that may inform preventive strategies and therapeutic interventions for disease phenotypes."

        "title": "Utilizing Sertoli Cell Transplantation as a Therapeutic Technique for the Management of Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases (NDs), such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Huntington's disease (HD), are defined by aberrant protein accumulation, brain atrophy, and gradual decline of neuronal function. Despite the considerable endeavors devoted to discovering treatments for NDs in recent decades, the demand for efficient therapeutic agents persists. Sertoli cells (SCs) play a crucial role in providing a supportive structure and environment for the development of germ cells. SCs, whether transplanted as xenogeneic or allogeneic cells, present a viable choice for enhancing graft persistence via the release of immunomodulatory and trophic factors, including neurturin\u00a0(NTN), platelet-derived growth factor, Fas (CD95) ligand (FasL), glial-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 1 (IL1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor, interleukin 6 (IL6), transforming growth factors, and vascular growth factor, that protect replaced cells and tissues from the immune system. However, there is currently no cohesive evidence regarding the neuroprotective influence of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. Therefore, this review focuses on assessing stem cells' neuroprotective impact on neurodegenerative diseases in pre-clinical settings and presenting cohesive information. A comprehensive search was conducted between 2000 and 2022. In the identification stage, after a comprehensive search across databases, including Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed/Medline, 103 papers were obtained. The search conducted in the present study yielded a total of nine relevant papers on the therapeutic effect of the transplantation of SCs on NDs. It was found that the transplantation of SCs exhibits a promising impact on enhancing the symptoms of neurological diseases in rats. The findings highlight the need for multiple standardized pre-clinical trials to find reliable information to confirm the utilization of the transplantation of SCs and the reduction of the symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases."

        "title": "Rehabilitation of Women with Neurodegenerative Diseases.",
        "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer's disease are 3 prevalent neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond disparate disease incidences between men and women, additional sex-related differences exist. Disease presentation, natural course, treatment considerations, genetic factors, hormonal factors, health care utilization patterns, and outcomes can vary between men and women in general. These disease processes represent examples of well-defined discrepancies between men and women afflicted. Other neurodegenerative conditions, such as motor neuron disorders, progressive supranuclear palsy, and multisystem atrophy, have shown to have a slight predilection toward men compared to women, yet have not been as extensively studied."

        "title": "Study insights in the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in neurological diseases: mechanisms and therapeutic potential.",
        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-<i>\u03b3</i> coactivator-1\u03b1 (PGC-1\u03b1), which is highly expressed in the central nervous system, is known to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial biosynthesis, metabolic regulation, neuroinflammation, autophagy, and oxidative stress. This knowledge indicates a potential role of PGC-1\u03b1 in a wide range of functions associated with neurological diseases. There is emerging evidence indicating a protective role of PGC-1\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases. As such, a deeper and broader understanding of PGC-1\u03b1 and its role in neurological diseases is urgently needed. The present review provides a relatively complete overview of the current knowledge on PGC-1\u03b1, including its functions in different types of neurons, basic structural characteristics, and its interacting transcription factors. Furthermore, we present the role of PGC-1\u03b1 in the pathogenesis of various neurological diseases, such as intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic stroke, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, and other PolyQ diseases. Importantly, we discuss some compounds or drug-targeting strategies that have been studied to ameliorate the pathology of these neurological diseases and introduce the possible mechanistic pathways. Based on the available studies, we propose that targeting PGC-1\u03b1 could serve as a promising novel therapeutic strategy for one or more neurological diseases."

        "title": "Mechanisms of ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation and their roles in age-related neurodegenerative disease.",
        "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by the progressive breakdown of neuronal structure and function and the pathological accumulation of misfolded protein aggregates and toxic protein oligomers. A major contributor to the deterioration of neuronal physiology is the disruption of protein catabolic pathways mediated by the proteasome, a large protease complex responsible for most cellular protein degradation. Previously, it was believed that proteolysis by the proteasome required tagging of protein targets with polyubiquitin chains, a pathway called the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Because of this, most research on proteasomal roles in neurodegeneration has historically focused on the UPS. However, additional ubiquitin-independent pathways and their importance in neurodegeneration are increasingly recognized. In this review, we discuss the range of ubiquitin-independent proteasome pathways, focusing on substrate identification and targeting, regulatory molecules and adaptors, proteasome activators and alternative caps, and diverse proteasome complexes including the 20S proteasome, the neuronal membrane proteasome, the immunoproteasome, extracellular proteasomes, and hybrid proteasomes. These pathways are further discussed in the context of aging, oxidative stress, protein aggregation, and age-associated neurodegenerative diseases, with a special focus on Alzheimer's Disease, Huntington's Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. A mechanistic understanding of ubiquitin-independent proteasome function and regulation in neurodegeneration is critical for the development of therapies to treat these devastating conditions. This review summarizes the current state of ubiquitin-independent proteasome research in neurodegeneration."
