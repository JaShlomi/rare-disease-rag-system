        "title": "Impact of Gene Modifiers on Cystic Fibrosis Phenotypic Profiles: A Systematic Review.",
        "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex monogenic disorder with a large variability in disease severity. Growing evidence suggests that the variation observed depends not only on variations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) gene but also on modifier genes. Utilizing five databases (including CINAHL, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus, and Web of Science), a systematic review was conducted to examine the current literature on the known impacts of genomic variations in modifier genes on the CF disease progression, severity, and therapeutic response. A total of 70 full-text articles describing over 80 gene modifiers associated with CF were selected. The modifier genes included genes associated with the CFTR interactome, the inflammatory response, microbial profiles, and other genes affecting the critical physiological pathways of multiple organ systems, such as the respiratory and gastrointestinal systems. Limitations of the existing literature embrace the lack of clinical studies investigating pharmacogenetic impacts and the significance of gene modifiers on the CF clinical picture, including a limited number of replication and validation studies. Further investigations into other potential gene modifiers using genome-wide association studies are needed to critically explore new therapeutic targets and provide a better understanding of the CF disease phenotype under specific drug treatments."

        "title": "Vancomycin Population Pharmacokinetic Models in Non- Critically Ill Adults Patients: a scoping review.",
        "abstract": "Vancomycin is an effective first-line therapy primarily in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection and Clostridium difficile, however, it has been shown that its effectiveness and the reduction of nephrotoxicity depend on maintaining adequate therapeutic levels. Population pharmacokinetic (PopPk) models attempt to parameterize the behavior of plasma concentrations in different target populations and scenarios such as renal replacement therapy, to successful therapeutic outcome and avoid these side effects.\nA scoping review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR), through a search in PubMed, LILACS, OVID Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, SAGE Journals, Google Scholar and previous known registers of PopPk models in non-critically ill adult patients, published between 1998 and 2024.\nA total of 190 papers were fully screened, of which were included 36 studies conducted in different populations; 12 in general population, 23 in special populations (surgical, with impaired renal function, obese, elderly, with cancer and cystic fibrosis), and 1 in mixed population (general and with cancer). The main parameters in the models were renal clearance and volume of distribution. The principal covariables that affected the models were creatinine clearance and weight. All studies used internal evaluation and 4 of them used an external group.\nThe technology for the development and implementation of PopPk models requires experts in clinical pharmacology and is limited to university and research centers. The software is mostly expensive and, in most cases, the pharmacokinetic models and the heterogeneity in the parameters and evaluation methods depend on which compartmental model, parameters, covariates and software have been used.\nThese models require validation in the clinical context and conducting experiments to adapt them for precision dosing in different subpopulations."

        "title": "A New Insight into Phage Combination Therapeutic Approaches Against Drug-Resistant Mixed Bacterial Infections.",
        "abstract": "Rising antibiotic resistance among bacterial pathogens has become a substantial health issue for human civilization. The emergence of these pathogens in high-risk diseases such as cystic fibrosis (CF) has led to financial and nonfinancial losses, necessitating alternative therapies. This study presents an overview of such approaches, including phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), nanotechnology, monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), microbial therapies (probiotic therapy), clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats technology (CRISPR), and aptamers focusing on their mechanisms of action and exploring the impact of combining phage and phage derivatives with the mentioned approaches. Although alternative approaches and their combinations with phages show promise, the phage-antibiotic combination has been the subject of most studies, and It has been proven to be highly effective in combating antibiotic-resistant infections. Other combinations also appear promising, but further studies are needed to determine their effectiveness. This emphasizes the need for more thorough research into different phage combination treatments beyond the well-established phage-antibiotic strategy."

        "abstract": "Compared with the widely used rodents, pigs are anatomically, physiologically, and genetically more similar to humans, making them high-quality models for the study of liver diseases. Here, we review the latest research progress on pigs as a model of human liver disease, including methods for establishing them and their advantages in studying cystic fibrosis liver disease, acute liver failure, liver regeneration, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, liver tumors, and xenotransplantation. We also emphasize the importance of genetic engineering techniques, mainly the CRISPR/Cas9 system, which has greatly enhanced the utility of porcine models as a tool for substantially advancing liver disease research. Genetic engineering is expected to propel the pig as one of the irreplaceable animal models for future biomedical research."

        "title": "The Pharmacokinetic Changes in Cystic Fibrosis Patients Population: Narrative Review.",
        "abstract": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare genetic disorder commonly affecting multiple organs such as the lungs, pancreas, liver, kidney, and intestine. Our search focuses on the pathophysiological changes that affect the drugs' absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). This review aims to identify the ADME data that compares the pharmacokinetics (PK) of different drugs in CF and healthy subjects. The published data highlight multiple factors that affect absorption, such as the bile salt precipitation and the gastrointestinal pH. Changes in CF patients' protein binding and body composition affected the drug distribution. The paper also discusses the factors affecting metabolism and renal elimination, such as drug-protein binding and metabolizing enzyme capacity. The majority of CF patients are on multidrug therapy, which increases the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI). This is particularly true for those receiving the newly developed transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), as they are at a higher risk for CYP-related DDI. Our research highlights the importance of meticulously evaluating PK variations and DDIs in drug development and the therapeutic management of CF patients."
